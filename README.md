# Todo-Calender app 
 	> in rust

This is my first Rust project and i decided to keep it simple but i do plan to make it featureful by adding calendar UI, reminders, run it on cloud with email services. but as of now, the plan is to achieve the following:
- [ ] add Todo Item and it may include
    - title
    - id
    - created time
    - due date
    - last modified time
    - status
    - link with other items (like how jira work)
    - link relationship

- [x] add item to list

- [ ] update an item in list

- [ ] delete one or more item by name

- [ ] filter options by status and due date
