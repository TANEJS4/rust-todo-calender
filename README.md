This is my first Rust project and i decided to keep it simple but i do plan to make it featureful by adding calendar UI, reminders, run it on cloud with email services. but as of now, the plan is to achieve the following:
- [x] add Todo Item and it may include
    - title
    - id
    - created time
    - due date
    - last modified time
    - status
    - [ ] link with other items (like how jira work)
    - [ ] link relationship

- [x] add item to list

- [x] update an item in list

- [x] delete one or more item by name

- [x] filter options by status and due date


- [ ] NEW :: Some form of GUI.
